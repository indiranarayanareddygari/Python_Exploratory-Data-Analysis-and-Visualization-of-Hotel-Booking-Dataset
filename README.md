### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization with Python

#### Introduction:
This GitHub repository contains Python code to explore and visualize a dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. The dataset, 'hotel_bookings 2.csv', involves hotel reservation details.

#### Folder Structure:
1. **Jupyter Notebook:** A detailed notebook (Jupyter) file (in the 'Notebooks' folder) contains the entire code, step-by-step analysis, and visualizations.
2. **Documentation:** A document (in the 'Documentation' folder) explaining the analysis performed, insights gained, and interpretations from the data.

#### Content Overview:
- **Data Loading and Inspection:** Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, columns, and basic statistics using Pandas methods like `head()`, `tail()`, and `info()`.

- **Data Cleaning:** Includes handling missing values, adjusting data types, dropping unnecessary columns ('company', 'agent'), and removing outliers for better analysis.

- **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Various visualizations generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries:
  - *Reservations:* Comparisons of canceled vs. not-canceled reservations.
  - *Hotel Analysis:* Distribution of reservation statuses across different hotels.
  - *Monthly Trends:* Analysis of trends in reservations over months, including average daily rates.

#### Documentation:
The 'Documentation' folder contains a detailed document summarizing the analysis insights, visualizations, and any notable observations derived from the dataset.

#### Usage:
1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file to view the code, analysis, and visualizations.
3. Refer to the Documentation folder for a comprehensive summary and insights gained from the analysis.
